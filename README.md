## Table of Contents
* [General Info](# Regression Model using regularization to solve a business problem in identifying the factors to predict house pricing)
* [Technologies Used](# Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn )
* [Conclusions](# We have identified 119 variables which have impact on pricing of a house)

## General Information
Linear Regression Model to find the impact of independent variables to predict the price of houses. The model is trained using Lasso Regression 
This model can predict the target variable if values of all independent values are known. This model can be used by business to identify prospective properties to buy to enter 
the market .
Business can also use this model while planning to expand in new markets.



## Conclusions
- Lasso and Ridge Regression solved overfitting issue in linear regression via regularization
- GrLivArea (Above grade (ground) living area square feet) is the most significant factor to determine price of a house. Higher the GrLivArea higher the price
- There are several attributes which are negatively affecting the price of house.
- Proximity to near positive off-site feature--park, greenbelt, etc. is the most negatively related attribute


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.0
- Jupyter Lab - version 3.2.1
